            <h1>Cookies</h1>
            <p>Have you ever been on a website and received a message asking you to accept all cookies? Before accepting it, have you ever wondered what a cookie is? That’s what you will learn right here.  </p>


            <h3>What’s a cookie?</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a small text file the server gives to a user’s web browser to keep certain information. The web browser keeps the data file until its expiration date. If it doesn’t have one, it will be erased when you close your browser. A cookie is sent by the browser alongside the web page. Afterwords, whenever you request a website’s page from its server, all the cookies related to this website will be sent with the request.  </p>

            <h3>What kind of information does it keep?  </h3>
            <p>It can contain much information like an identifier, a product order, a language preference, a color theme, and much more. In fact, a server can’t remember an old client so the web browser must keep a login identifier in a cookie to be remembered by the server when you navigate on the site. Therefore, the site remembers you and you don’t have to put your login information every time you change pages on websites. For instance, if you add an article to your cart on Amazon, the server remembers it’s yours. When you pay for your cart, the website knows who you are and what you bought. You are not paying for someone else’s cart after all.  </p>

            <h3>Is it dangerous? </h3>
            <p>At the end of the day, a cookie is just a virus-free text file, so it is not that harmful since it does not execute anything on your computer. However, third-party cookies are something else. Certain websites have cookies that come from other websites. Some companies use those to know what site you visited to sell targeted advertisements. If you hate targeted ads, do not forget to erase your cookies on your web browser.  </p>
