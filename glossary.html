                    <p>
                        Antivirus software is a program that you install on your computer, which will frequently scan to find any security threats
                        in the files that are already on your computer as well as the ones, you download from the internet. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-apk">Bandwidth</h3>
                    <p>
                        The bandwith is the maximum amount of data that can be sent on an internet connection at the same time.

                    <h3 id="glos-cache">Cache</h3>
                    <p>
                        Cache is a small amount of memory that is used to store recently open, or frequently accessed files, so that your computer doesn’t have 
                        to go get said file from the hard drive every time you ask for it. This is used to speed up the process of finding files.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-client">Client</h3>
                    <p>
                        Client is a term used to distinguish the two computers in an interaction between a server and another device. For example, your computer
                        is the client that asks for data from a server.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-database">Database</h3>

                        A database is a file that contains information that is organized in a certain way, which can be defined by whoever created the database. It 
                        is similar to a dictionary, where words all have a definition and are organized in alphabetical order.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-databreach">Data Breach</h3>
                    <p>
                        A data breach is a term which is used to define when an intruder manages to get a hold of confidential data in a database, which is supposed
                        to be secured and inaccessible to the public.  
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-domain">Domain</h3>
                    <p>
                        A Domain is the base name of a website address. For example, marketplace or messenger all share the Facebook domain.

                    <h3 id="glos-ftp">FTP</h3>

                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-hacker">Hacker</h3>
                    <p>
                        A hacker is someone who manages to enter a network or device that isn't supposed to be accessible. For example, people aren't supposed to use your computer
                        since it belongs to you, but a hacker will find a way to access its content without your knowledge.
                    </p>

                        A class is what is used to group multiple elements of an HTML page. Let's say you want multiple images to have the same outline, they will use the same 
                        class.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-id">HTML ID</h3>
                    <p>
                        It works like a class, but you only put it on one element of an HTML page.
                    </p>

                    
                    <h3 id="glos-javascript">JavaScript</h3>

                    </p>

                    <h3 id="glos-mvc">Modal-View-Controller (MVC)</h3>
                    <p>
                        MVC is a software architecture pattern used to develop web applications. The “M” stands for Modal. The modal is the structure of the data used. The “V” stands for view. A view is a visual interface representing the data. Often, views are web pages. The “C” stands for controller. A controller enumerates the actions a user can do, and it determines how to manipulate the data.
                    </p>

                    
                    <h3 id="glos-network">Network</h3>
