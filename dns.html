          <h1>DNS servers</h1>
          <p>
            With the ever-growing number of IP addresses on a single network, it became difficult to work with the IP system. Therefore, the DNS system was invented in 1980 to allow computers to use a significant name instead of an IP address to find a server. A DNS server’s role is to redirect your computer to the desired IP address. 
          </p>
          <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
          <p>
            Even if your computer knows the domain name of your target, it doesn’t necessarily know the route to reach this website. Afterall, a domain name is not an IP address. As such, it needs a DNS to know the path to the targeted server. In short, your computer searches for a domain’s IP address in its cache. If it wasn’t kept in memory, your computer asks a DNS server to find the IP address corresponding to the domain name. In other words, a DNS server translate text to IP addresses. It is a phonebook for computers addresses.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Recursive Search
          </h3>
          <p>
            Of course, a single DNS server can’t keep addresses for every domain in the world. Keeping track of billions of domain names would be unimaginable. That’s why DNS servers asks others recursively for IP addresses they don’t know or don’t have in their cache. For instance, if you’re searching for “www.clg.qc.ca”, your computer will send a request to your internet provider’s DNS server, which will in turn ask the “ca” DNS server for the address, which will ask the “qc” server for the address, which will return the address corresponding to “clg”. Of course, once you found it, your web browser won’t ask for it again since it is kept in its cache. 
          </p>


          <h3>DNS Security</h3>
          <p>
            Of course, DNS servers aren’t always safe. In fact, DNS servers can track your web history and sell it to advertisers. Moreover, hackers who take over a server can use this information for malicious goals. Hackers can also redirect you to fake websites without your knowledge. That’s why you should use trusted DNS servers, such as your internet provider’s server. On top of that, you can change your DNS server in your computer’s network settings. For instance, you could change it for 8.8.8.8, Google’s DNS server.
