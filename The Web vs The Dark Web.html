            <h1>The Web versus the Dark Web</h1>

            <h3>The origins of the World Wide Web</h3>
            <p>
              First, let's define what the Web means. In the computer sense of the term, the Web is an array of interconnected documents. The similarity to a spider web in its 
              structure explains well the choice of the word for the invention. The Web was created to easily allow a user to navigate, and access all its documents, without 
              having to enter its specific address every time. The first version of the World Wide Web, also known simply as the Web, was invented by a British scientist by the 
              name of Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, working at CERN, which is the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The World Wide Web, as we know it, was made available 
              to the public in 1992. It was then put in the public domain on 30 April 1993 by CERN.
            </p>    

            <h3>How a browser finds content on the Web</h3>
            <p>
              The first thing that is essential to understand about the Web is that only a tiny fraction of it is accessible with your typical Web browser, like Google or Bing. 
              We say typical because as we will discuss later, there are some web browsers that can access its content. The way that a browser can find a website is simple. It 
              will look for the domain or the Ip address that the user types in the search bar. If the content you are looking for is indexed, meaning that the address you are 
              looking for is visible for your browser, is registered, and public, then the server on which the content is hosted will send you back said content. Otherwise, 
              you will most likely get an error message saying that you don’t have the permission to access the content you are looking for (Error 403) or the content was not  
              found at all (Error 404). The Deep Web is the term used when talking about all the content which is inaccessible. It is estimated that the deep web represents 
              about 95% of all the content on the web. The infamous Dark Web is a very small percentage of the Deep Web, about 0.01%
            </p>  

            <h3>What is the Deep Web</h3>
            <p>
              Let’s start with the deep web. The deep web is for the most part legitimate content that is unrelated to any criminal activity. It includes emails, chat messages, 
              private content on social media, electronic bank statements, etc. None of these are available if you search for them on google, but they can all be accessed if you 
              have the authorization to do so. The fact that most of the web is impossible to find on a typical search engine has a lot of advantages. First, it makes your search 
              results a lot more relevant since they won’t include most of the irrelevant content. Secondly, privacy is increased on the web since your bank statements, and such 
              are unavailable for others to find.
            </p>  

            <h3>What is the Dark Web</h3>
            <p>
              On the other hand, the dark web is a term that refers to all the illegal content that is unindexed, therefore, invisible for your typical web browser. It is highly 
              recommended to avoid going on the dark web, since your will most definitely get viruses, and you may find some highly disturbing content. For example, the most famous 
              website on the dark web was called The Silk Road. It was a web market, like Amazon or eBay, that sold everything from guns to drugs to body parts. Obviously, all of 
              that is highly illegal and is the reason why the website was taken down. Now it is obvious that the people that buy things on these kinds of websites don’t want to 
              be tracked, so they use a VPN to hide their real location. For obvious security and legal reasons, your browser, whether it is Google Chrome or Firefox or any regular 
              browser, cannot reach these websites. The dark web can however be accessed with some special browsers like Tor, but we highly recommend avoiding going on it because 
              there is a big chance that you will get a virus.
            </p>     
            
            <h3>What are crypto currencies</h3>
            <p>
              Crypto currencies are, to put it simply, a virtual form of money that doesn’t have a real life equivalent, meaning they don't have physical bills or coins. Canadian 
              dollars, or any other traditional currency, has both a physical and virtual representation of its value. The physical representation is in the form of coins and dollar 
              bills, whereas its virtual representation is the number that you see on your online bank account. Crypto currencies on the other hand, only have a virtual representation. 
              The main advantage of crypto currencies is that unlike cash, they can be stored without government oversight. This means that unlike the transactions that are done with 
              your bank account, which is registered in your name, there is no direct link between your identity and your crypto currency transactions. The dark web market is highly 
              dependant on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin simply because it is more private than typical currencies, making it easier for criminal to run their operations without 
              getting caught.
