            <h1>Servers</h1>
            <h3>What is a server</h3>
            <p>
                Broadly, a server is a computer that manages a <a href="glossary.html#glos-network">network</a>. That means that like the <a href="glossary.html#glos-internet">Internet</a>, 
                it sends and receives data to and from your device. There are multiple types of servers, 
                mail servers, file servers, network servers and database servers. 
            </p>
            <h3>Network Servers</h3>
            <p>
                A network server is used to listen to the requests sent from a client machine over a network. 
                This means that if you type the URL of a <a href="glossary.html#glos-website">website</a>, it is the network server that will handle 
                the request and send you to the <a href="glossary.html#glos-website">website</a>. It is the most basic type of server since its job 
                it to transfer handle the data transfer from one point to another, it is the base for the
                 other types of servers, which are specialized in a specific aspect of data transferring. 
                 Today, they are more widely know as genera purpose servers since they can do a bit of 
                 everything. 
            </p>
            <h3>Mail Servers</h3>
            <p>
                A mail server is basically a virtual post office. Its role is to assure that an email that 
                was sent reaches its destination. The reason that these exist and that you can’t simply 
                send an email directly form a computer to another is that it bridges the gaps between 
                different domains. Without the server, you would only be able to send your emails to 
                other devices on the same domain as you.
            </p>
            <h3>File Servers</h3>
            <p>
                A file server, as the name indicates, stores files. These are useful for services that 
                send files to the user, for example, any <a href="glossary.html#glos-website">website</a> that has a download link, send you the 
                files of the download from a file server. Streaming <a href="glossary.html#glos-website">websites</a> like YouTube or Netflix also 
                have massive file servers that store all the content that they feature. A file server 
                usually has a lot of hard drives that all store data. The data can be accessed upon a 
                request, which contains instructions like what files to send to the request sender. 
                Another application of a file server is to store backups of files and programs in case 
                there are any issues with it. Let’s say you download a game and for some reason some 
                of the files are corrupted, the back up on the sever ensures that there is still a 
                functioning version of said game somewhere, that can be used to repair the corrupted files.
            </p>
            <h3>Database Servers</h3>
            <p>
                Lastly, a database server is in charge of storing data. Unlike the file server, it doesn’t 
                contain files. Instead, it contains text base information, like username and passwords. 
                Every account you create on a <a href="glossary.html#glos-website">website</a> is stored on a database. What a database contains 
                changes from a service to another. Let’s say you want to see your bank account from your
                banks portal, all the information concerning your account is stored on a database, whether 
                its your card number, your account number, your password, or your balance. Every text-based 
                information regarding your account is stored in a database.  
            </p>
            <h3>Database Safety</h3>
            <p>
                The main security concern with databases is that they contain almost all your sensitive 
                information, so if a data breach happens, there is a high possibility that your personal 
                data ends up in malicious hands. Luckily, the odds of a breach happening are low since 
                databases are very secure and their data is encrypted. Still, for safety reasons, it is 
                best to not enter sensitive information needlessly in a <a href="glossary.html#glos-website">website</a>, to prevent any leak of 
                information.
