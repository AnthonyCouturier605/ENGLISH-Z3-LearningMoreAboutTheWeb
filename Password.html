            <h1>Password Security</h1>
            <h3>How easy is it to crack your password?</h3>
            <p>
                Well first, we need to understand how hackers manage to get a hold of our passwords. 
                The two main techniques used by hackers to crack our passwords are with malware and brute forcing.
            </p>   
            <h3>Malware</h3>
            <p>
                A malware is a malicious piece of software that allows the hacker to get a lot of information stored on your computer, 
                including your passwords. The most common way that people end up with malware on their computers is when they download 
                something from a shady website. By the time you notice that you have malware on your computer, if you even notice at all, 
                it’s already too late and the hacker has access to all your information. The best way to avoid getting malware is to avoid shady websites, 
                as well as to use an antivirus, If you find a free 
                download link for a usually paid software, that’s a huge red flag, because if a deal seems too good to be true, it is 
                most definitely a scam.
            </p>  
            <h3>Brute Force</h3> 
            <p>
                Another way commonly used by hackers to get your passwords is brute forcing. The way this technique works is quite simple. 
                The hacker will use a program that will try all possible combinations of characters to eventually find your password. 
                For example, if your password is 123, the program will try all the possible number combinations and eventually end up on 
                your password. 000,001,002,003, etc.… This is the reason a lot of websites require a password that is at least 8 characters, 
                because the longer your password is, the safer it is from this method. To put password strength into perspective, the 
                password !@#$%^&*()dfertifyn would take about 3000 years to crack, so it is pretty secure. On the other hand, if you remove 
                the letters and only keep !@#$%^&*(), it would take around 2 seconds to crack. 
            </p>
