          <h1>Downloads</h1>
          <p>
            Downloading is a process where you copy a file from a server on your hard drive. On the other hand, Uploading is a process where you send a copy of your file to a server. When downloading a file from a file server, the protocol used to transmit data is <a href="glossary.html#glos-ftp">FTP</a>, whereas, with a web server, the protocol used is HTTP.  Downloads are not restricted to text files. In fact, you can download a different file type such as videos, documents, images, audio, etc. Some of those files are heavy and cannot be transferred to your computer directly in one go, so how does it work?
          </p>

          <h3>
            How computers exchange data on a network
          </h3>
          <p>
            Large messages cannot be sent in one request since it would slow down the entire network. Therefore, this kind of data is segmented into <a href="glossary.html#glos-packets">packets</a>. Sending a huge file in one go would be problematic. In fact, if the message doesn’t reach the destination, we would have to send the entire file again. Moreover, this is unproductive since a huge file could monopolize the <a>bandwidth</a>. While a packet is being transmitted in a cable, other packets can’t be transmitted. A big packet would use the cable for a enormous amount of time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With multiple packets, the message is sent in independent segments. Those pieces of data can take different routes to reach their destination. Therefore, it doesn’t fully utilize the networks capacity, and lost packets can easily be resent without returning the entirety of the data. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, a computer cannot receive a huge file in one piece. This is another reason why the data is divided into packets.  Computers receive those packets and pieces them together to obtain the file requested.
          </p>

          <h3>How does your computer reassemble messages?</h3>
          <p>
            The body of the packet is called the payload, whereas the header is a label providing valuable information such as the order of the packet, its origin, and its destination. For instance, IP packets are used with the IP protocol. Its header contains the <a href="glossary.html#glos-ip">IP address</a> of the origin and its destination. Without headers, your computer can’t reassemble packets since it wouldn’t know where it came from and the order of the message.
          </p>

          <h3>Safe downloads</h3>
          <p>
            The best way to download in complete security is to use an antivirus to scan your downloads. Moreover, you should only download from secure sources such as the Microsoft Store or websites using the HTTPS protocol. If the website is suspicious, avoid downloads. On mobile, you should only download applications from your phone’s app store.
