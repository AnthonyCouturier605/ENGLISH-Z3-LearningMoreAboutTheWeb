            <h1>Wi-Fi</h1>
            <h3>How does the internet work?</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing we need to understand is the difference between Wi-Fi and the internet.  The Internet is a system which 
                allows computers to connect with each other around the world. Each device uses a unique IP address. There are 2 different 
                IP protocols, IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is constructed with 4 numbers that range from 0 to 255. For example, and IPv4 address
                 would look like this :216.58.216.164. There are also special addresses that have a specific meaning. For example, the 
                 address 0.0.0.0/8 is used to communicate with a local network, so it cannot be assigned to your computer since it cannot be 
                 used to communicate with the internet. The main issue that IPv4 runs into is that the maximum number of addresses is 4.3 
                 billion, which nowadays isn’t, enough to supply every single computer. This is the reason that most computers have a dynamic
                  IP address. This means that it gets assigned a new IP address when it connects to a network. Since there are never 4.3 billion
                   devices connected at one time, this circulation of addresses allows the protocol to still be effective while using a limited 
                   number of addresses. On the other hand, IPv6 uses eight groups containing four hexadecimal digits, which is a base 16 number. 
                   A typical IPv6 address looks like this: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. This format allows for 340 trillion trillion 
                   trillion different addresses, so it is basically impossible to run out of addresses . This protocol is newer and less used than IPv4
            </p>   
            <h3>How does Wi-Fi work?</h3>
            <p>
                On the other hand, Wi-Fi allows devices to communicate with each other wirelessly, on a much smaller scale than the internet. 
                The reason you have internet over Wi-Fi is that the device you are using is connecting via Wi-Fi to a router, which is connected 
                to the internet. The router will then send the data from the internet to the device you connected to it. The way that Wi-Fi 
                uses to transmit data is radio waves. The two main frequencies used by Wi-Fi are 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. Both have pros and cons, for 
                example, 2.4Ghz can transmit data over much longer distances than 5Ghz. On the other hand, 5Ghz can transmit data much faster. However, 
                2.4Ghz is a frequency used by a lot of devices that use radio waves, so it is more likely to have interference while using this frequency. 
                In short, Wi-Fi is a wireless communication technology that bridges the gap from a device to a router, allowing the user to connect to 
                the internet without the need to be plugged into a modem with a cable.
