            <h3>Differences between Web browsers</h3>
            <p>
              A web browser can interpret data differently, leading to potentially a different visual and functional result for the same web page from one 
              browser to another. These differences can occur if a browser is running an older version of JavaScript or HTML, leading to some unsupported 
              features that can cause visual glitches. Different bases are used by web browsers. The most well-known is the chromium base, which is open-source 
              and developed by Google. Some notable browsers that are based on chromium are Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Microsoft Edge. Its main competitor 
              is the Firefox base which is notably used by Firefox and Tor. Yes, the same Tor that is used to access the Dark Web. Tor is not a browser that 
              was created for the dark web, but its integrated VPN and top-of-the-line encrypted connection are simply a must-choose to access the Dark Web 
              Safely. Lastly, there is the well-known, and now discontinued Internet Explorer, which had been in use since 1995, as part of the Windows 95 
              operating system.

            <h3>The most used Web browsers</h3>
            <p>
              The most used Web browser in 2022 is Google chrome, with a staggering 65.52% market share. Its accessibility and ease of use make it a no-brainer 
              for most people, hence its dominance over the industry. In second Place, we have Safari, which is apple’s Web browser. It is the default browser 
              on all their products, which explains its second place since they have over 50% of the United States mobile phone market share. For the third place, 
              we have Microsoft edge, which is the default Web browser for Windows, followed by Firefox. All the other browsers have their fans thanks to a unique 
              feature set and some UI and quality of life differences, but their market share is small enough that we don’t think they are worth mentioning. 
              These are the main Web Browsers used in 2022.
