          <h1>Spyware</h1>
          <p>
            A spyware is a type of malware that infects your device and steals your information in secret. 
            Anybody can be the target of spywares since their goal is to collect personal information and monitor a user’s behaviour. 
            It can even lead to identity theft. This virus can track which sites you visited, or it can find your email and your passwords. 
            On a mobile device, a spyware can collect data about your localization with GPS, SMS messages sent, call logs, contacts list, and photos. 
            Some spywares even log your keystrokes to know what you’re typing. Mobile spywares are hard to detect since they don’t create an app shortcut
             and it’s harder to notice what processes are running in the background. A spyware creates data breaches. Most of the time, 
             a spyware runs in the background, and you’ll never notice it. Even if you do, it would be too late. Uninstalling a spyware is not an 
             easy task.
          </p>

           
           <h3>Types of Spyware</h3>
           <p>
            Most of the time, the functionality of a spyware is determined by its creator. Some spywares are more suited to steal a particular 
            type of data. For instance, password stealers harvest login credentials and passwords of infected computers. 
            Banking Trojans target financial institutions like banks. Without the client and the server’s knowledge, they modify web pages 
            and transaction details. Info stealers collect information such as usernames, passwords, email addresses, browser history, log files,
             documents, pictures and so on. Keyloggers track user input including chat conversations, keystrokes or even video calls. 
             They can even take screenshots to monitor your computer.
           </p>

           <h3>How Do You Get Spyware?</h3>
           <p>
            Some websites or applications have security vulnerabilities which hackers can use to create a backdoor. Afterwards, they can use this backdoor to exploit the website or the app’s users.
            Several programs market themselves as useful programs with good intentions such as speeding up your computer, but their real goal is to install a spyware on your computer to collect data. Be careful when you download shady programs.
            Various spywares are installed as a bundle with other software without your knowledge. Even if you uninstall the original software, the plugin will remain on your computer.
            A portion of spywares make their way into your device when you click on a Trojan horse, a fake file. For instance, you may click on a PDF file that is in reality a .exe file creating a backdoor on your computer. Be careful when you download a file and always keep an eye on the file extension instead of the file’s image.
            <a href="glossary.html#glos-phishing">Phishing</a> is also a way to get spywares.
            
           </p>

           <h3>What to Do After Getting Spied On</h3>
           <p>
            Try to clear your system and reset your computer. Informing your bank that you might have been the victim of fraud is important. Change your PIN code and your passwords since hackers might know them. Afterwards, protect yourself with malware removers and antiviruses.
           </p>

           
           <h3>How to Avoid Spywares</h3>
           <p>
            The best way to avoid getting spywares is to be careful on the Internet. Steer clear of shady websites and suspicious emails. 
            If you receive an email from an unknown sender, do not open it. If you receive an email from an important institution like a bank, 
            do not click on the link. Instead, visit the real page by yourself because it might not be your actual bank. Furthermore, 
            before clicking on a link, hover your mouse over it to see where the link will send you. Moreover, you should only download files 
            from a trusted source. On mobile devices, download apps from trusted shops, such as the App Store and the Play Store. Downloading 
            <a href="glossary.html#glos-apk">APK</a> files on the web or from messages is a risky idea. To avoid spywares from spreading, avoid using personal devices at work. 
            Additionally, be careful on public WIFI since hackers can see everything you do. Free unsecured WIFI shouldn’t be used to transmit 
            personal and secret data. Also. Try to use a trustworthy browser such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to ensure your security on 
            the web. Most of all, use a trusted antivirus to enhance cybersecurity and protect yourself from malwares. Popular cybersecurity 
            programs include McAfee, Norton, Malwarebytes Premium, Bitdefender Antivirus Plus and the built-in antivirus on Windows, Microsoft 
            Defender Antivirus.
