          <h1>Deconstructing URLs</h1>
          <h3>Definition</h3>
          <p>
            URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a sequence of characters, also called a string by programmers, 
            that represents a resource path. This path is different from your normal computer file path. Let's deconstruct one.
          </p>

          <h3>Protocol</h3>
          <p>The <i>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</i> (HTTP) is a communication protocol dictating a way to exchange information between a web server and a client. 
            More often than not, the protocol used on a website is HTTPS. The “S” stands for Secure. This variant encrypts the connection and the information before communicating. 
            Therefore, it is much more secure. If you need to input personal information such as a credit card number or your address on a website using the HTTP protocol, 
            beware of this web page. Anyone who intercepts your server-targeted message can easily steal your information. 
            What’s the best way to keep your personal data private? You should <b>never</b> pay or disclose personally identifiable information on 
            an insecure website. Keep an eye out for the “S” or the little lock next to the URL.
          </p>
          <image src="Images/url_lock.jpg" class="contained-image"/>

          <h3>Domain</h3>
          <p>
            A domain name is a sequence of characters identifying a network domain or an <a>IP address</a>. 
            For instance, "google.com" is a domain name addressed to Google’s network of servers. 
            In short, a computer searches for the IP address in its <a>cache</a>. 
            If it doesn’t find it, it asks a DNS server to find the IP address linked to the domain name. 
            Read the upcoming lesson on DNS servers to understand how computers find servers with domain names.
          </p>

          <h3>Resource</h3>
          <p>
            The resource is the path of the file. For example, the resource “Images/url_deconstruction.png” represents the file
             “url_deconstruction.png” in the Images folder according to the <a>web root</a> folder. 
             Therefore, the current page is located in the "urls.html" file in the web root folder. 
             This structure, "{folder}/{fileName}", is similar to Windows File Explorer, available on personal computers; 
             however, it is not the only way to identify a resource on the web. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <a>Modal-View-Controller (MVC)</a> has a different pattern: "{controller}/{action}/{id}". 
            An id is a number identifying a resource, such as a user or a post. An action is a command an online user can execute on the website
             including deleting a post, editing a post, creating a post, logging in to a website, subscribing, liking a post, etc. 
             An action can also render a view, more commonly know as a webpage. A controller is an object containing a group of action. 
             It is responsible for calling the action when the user asks for it. 
             For instance, if your URL is “domainname.com/Posts/edit/1”, the controller will call the edit action for the first post, 
             which renders an editing formular.
          </p>

          <h3>Query String</h3>
          <p>
            A query string is a set of parameters found after an interrogation mark in a URL. 
            Each parameter is separated by an ampersand. Those are sent alongside the request to the server with HTTP. 
            Then, the server can read the parameters and use them in code. 
            In the example above, the parameters could be used to sort data in descending order where the name contains “test”.
          </p>

          <h3>Method</h3>
          <p>
            There are different communication methods in the HTTP protocol. The most popular ones are the GET method and the POST method. 
            GET is more often used to request a resource, so the query string is in the URL. 
            POST is used to send data to a server and the query string is hidden inside the HTTP request. 
            A URL is easily modifiable and accessible, so you shouldn’t find important information in a URL’s query string. 
            If you do find some, it likely means the site is not so secure. Moreover, POST parameters are not kept in a web browser’s history, 
            which enhances security.
          </p>

          <h3>Dangers with the GET method and the POST method</h3>
